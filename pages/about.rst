:slug: about

Hey! I'm Patrick Cloke. This is my (not so) exciting website! Thanks for
visiting.

I graduated from `Rensselaer Polytechnic Insitute`_ (RPI to people "in the
know") in 2010 with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, a Bachelor
of Science in Electrical Engineering and a Master of Engineering in Electrical
Engineering (with a concentration in `control theory`_).

I've been part of the Mozilla_ community since ~2006 (although I don't seem to
have any way to prove that). I started by writing extensions and eventually
started contributing directly in 2008_. I had trouble initially getting involved
in such a massive project, but then came across Instantbird_ in ~2008 (sometime
in the Instantbird 0.1 era). I thought this was great -- Mozilla was finally
making an instant messaging client! Well, I was kind of right... Anyway, I fixed
my first bug for that in 2010_ and haven't stopped since! I've added `IRC
support`_ and am now one of the lead developers. I also work on the Thunderbird_
e-mail client's `chat code`_ and occassionally other Mozilla-esque things.

Besides my open source contributions, I'm also interested in: Ultimate, disc
golf, reading (mostly science fiction, in particular Star Wars, Dune and
Foundation) and video games (well, when I had time for that).
