Hey! I'm Patrick Cloke. This is my (not so) exciting website! Thanks for
visiting.

I graduated from `Rensselaer Polytechnic Insitute`_ (RPI to people "in the know")
in 2010 with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, a Bachelor of
Science in Electrical Engineering and a Master of Engineering in Electrical
Engineering (with a concentration in `control theory`_).

I've been contributing to Mozilla_ since 2008_, but had been writing extensions
well before that (my guess is ~2006, although I don't seem to have any of that
code in repositories to prove it). I had trouble trying to get involved in
Mozilla since it was such a massive project, but then I came across Instantbird_
in 2008 or so (sometime in the Instantbird 0.1 era). I thought this was great --
Mozilla was finally making an instant messaging client! Well, I was kind of
right... Anyway, I fixed my first bug for that in 2010_ and haven't stopped
since! I've added `IRC support`_ and am one of the lead developers for it now. I
also work on the Thunderbird_ e-mail client, in particular to support the various
instant messaging features.

Besides my open source contributions, other interests include, Ultimate, Disc
golf, reading (mostly science fiction, in particular Star Wars, Dune and
Foundation) and video games (well, when I had time for that).
