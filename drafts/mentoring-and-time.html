</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>No, this is not about being late places, it&#8217;s about respecting people&#8217;s time. I
won&#8217;t go super into this as, Michael Haggerty wrote an awesome <a class="reference external" href="http://softwareswirl.blogspot.fr/2014/03/my-secret-tip-for-gsoc-success.html">article</a> on this.
His thoughts boild down to a single line of advice:
&quot;<strong><span class="caps">DON</span>&#8217;T <span class="caps">WASTE</span> <span class="caps">OTHER</span> <span class="caps">PEOPLE</span>&#8217;S <span class="caps">TIME</span></strong>&quot;.</p>
<p>I think this applies to more than just Google Summer of Code mentoring, and not
only open source work, but anything where someone is mentoring and helping you!
This advice isn&#8217;t meant just for GSoC students, interns or new employees, but
also things I&#8217;d like to remind myself to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>To make this sound a little more positive, I&#8217;d reword his advice as <strong>Respect
people&#8217;s time!</strong>. Someone is willing to help you, so assume some good faith,
but help them help you. Some actions to focus&nbsp;on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ask <em>focused</em> questions! If you do not understand an answer, do not <em>re-ask</em>
the same question, but ask <em>followup</em> question. Show you&#8217;ve researched the
original answer and attempted to understand it. Write sample code, play with
it, etc. If you think the answer given doesn&#8217;t apply to your question,
<em>reword</em> your question: your mentor probably did not&nbsp;understand.</li>
<li>Be cognizant of <em>timezones</em>: if you&#8217;d like a question asked (in realtime), ask
it when the person is awake! (And this includes realizing if they have just
woken up or are going to&nbsp;bed.)</li>
<li>They will not have the <em>context</em> you do: your &quot;mentor&quot; might be helping many
people at once, try not to get frustrated if you have to explain your context
to them multiple times or have to clarify your question. You are living and
breathing the code you&#8217;re working in; they are&nbsp;not.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to <em>post code</em>. It&#8217;s much easier to ask a question when
there&#8217;s an example in front of you. Be specific and don&#8217;t talk&nbsp;theoretically.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be upset about an <em>r-</em> (a rejected change)! Part of helping you to grow
is telling you what you&#8217;re doing&nbsp;wrong.</li>
<li>Working <em>remotely</em> is hard. It requires effort to build a level of trust
between people. Don&#8217;t just assume it will come in time, but work at it and try
to get to know and understand your&nbsp;mentor.</li>
<li><em>Quickly</em> respond to both feedback and questions. Your mentor is taking the
time out of whatever they&#8217;re doing to help you. If they ask you a question or
ask something of you, do it now&nbsp;(well&#8230;*soon*).</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above is a lot to handle, but it can make it a join to work with a&nbsp;mentor.</p>
<p>Mentoring is also hard and a skill to practice. Although I&#8217;ve talked a lot
about what a mentee needs to do, it is also important that a mentor leaves
h(im|er)self open. A few thoughts on interacting as a&nbsp;mentor:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Be cognizant of <em>culture</em> and <em>language</em> (as in how well a mentor and mentee
share their common language). In particular, colloquialisms should be avoided
whenever possible. At least until a level of trust is&nbsp;reached.</li>
<li>Be tactful when <em>giving feedback</em>. Thank people for submitting a patch, give
good, <em>actionable</em> feedback quickly. Concentrate more on overall code design
and algorithms than nits. (Maybe even point out nits, but fix them yourself
for an initial&nbsp;patch.)</li>
</ul>
