I'm officially a mentor this year for `2013's Google Summer of Code`_.
I'm a bit late on posting this, but oh well! My student this year is
`Quentin Headen`_ who is `working on`_ a `Yahoo! Messenger protocol`_
for the Instantbird chat/ backend (so it'll also be usable via
Thunderbird). You can see `an account of his trials, successes and
trepidations`_ (`RSS`_) or follow his `code repository`_. He's made
great progress so far and is able to connect, download all the buddies
and start private conversations! Not too bad for a few weeks of work!
We've been keeping a `TODO list`_ of things to be supported, please
don't edit it without discussing it with us first.

Our hope is to get this checked into Instantbird by the end of summer
and run it in parallel (behind an about:config preference) with the
current libpurple Yahoo implementation. Once we're satisified that it
has feature parity we'll remove the libpurple version and enable this by
default!

Instantbird is also supporting two other projects:

-  The `"Awesometab"`_ is being done by `Nihanth Subramanya`_
   (`RSS <http://awesometab.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss>`__)
   and being mentored by Benedikt Pfeifer, his code is `available`_ and
   some has already been `checked`_ `into`_ `Instantbird`_ `nightlies`_!
-  `FileLinks in IM`_ is being worked on by `Atul Jangra`_ (or `maybe`_)
   (`RSS <http://atuljangra.tumblr.com/rss>`__ /
   `RSS <http://gsoc-mozilla.tumblr.com/rss>`__) and being mentored by
   Florian Qu√®ze, check out the `repository`_.

You can find any of us in #instantbird on irc.mozilla.org, my nick is
clokep, Quentin's is qheaden, Nihanth's: nhnt11, Atul's: atuljangra,
Benedikt goes by Mic and Florian goes by something starting with "flo".

Thanks also go out to Mozilla for letting us participate in Google
Summer of Code with them again! You can see all of the accepted projects
in `Gerv's blogpost`_.
