Currently I have a working patch up in `bug 976`_ (you can CC yourself to get
updates!). There's a few things to handle still (I think): localization and
ensuring it builds on non-Windows platforms for sure. I think once those are
done it can be landed in Instantbird once someone has time to review it! Let me
know if you're interested in helping out!
