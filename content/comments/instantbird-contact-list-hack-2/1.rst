I looked at the source, of course! :-D

Specifically
http://lxr.instantbird.org/instantbird/source/instantbird/content/blist.xul and
related:
http://lxr.instantbird.org/instantbird/source/instantbird/content/contact.xml
and http://lxr.instantbird.org/instantbird/source/instantbird/content/group.xml

I'd also certainly suggest hopping on IRC if you have any questions
(#instantbird on irc.mozilla.org).

I'm glad you found this useful!
