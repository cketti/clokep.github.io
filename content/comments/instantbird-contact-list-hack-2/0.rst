In addition...

.. code-block:: css

    group {
    font-size: 1em;
    background-color: #D6D6D5;
    }
    contact {
    font-size: 1.1em;
    font-weight: bold;
    overflow-y: inherit;
    background-color: #D6D6D5;
    }
    buddy {
    font-size: 1em;
    }

And background-color values can be removed. It is just like my miranda im buddy
list now. Everything gray! Only thing I'm missing is the user icons in the list.

I wanted to ask from where you know the name of the classes so you can modify
them? Maybe not so smart question but lack of documentation about those stuff
draws me back.
