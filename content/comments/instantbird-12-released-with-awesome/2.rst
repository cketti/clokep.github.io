I mostly work on the chat backend that is shared between Instantbird and
Thunderbird as well as Instantbird specific bugs. But I do review bugs for
Thunderbird chat specific stuff, occasionally file bugs in Thunderbird and work
on them and offer feedback as well.

There's plenty of people interesting on continuing the work on Thunderbird and
there's a community of developers working to keep it viable. I think we'll see
Thunderbird around for a long time.
