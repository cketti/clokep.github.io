I think having the student fix a non trivial bug is interesting because it shows
how the student will handle the review process: will he be happy to be mentored
to improve the quality of his submission? Will he be annoyed that his patch
isn't perfect the first time? Having these interactions tells a lot about how it
will feel like to mentor the student during the summer.

I don't think it should be required; but students should know it will be taken
into account by possible mentors while evaluation their applications.
