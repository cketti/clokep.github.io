Thanks for your feedback! I'm not sure if it's just early in the morning here,
but I'm having trouble understanding your sentence. I think you're saying:
"Given more stringent requirements, how many successful GSoC projects would not
have happened?"

I agree that this would be an interesting number to look at. I'd also be curious
about the other: "Given more stringent requirements, how many failed GSoC
projects would not have happened?" Maybe it's worth cutting out a little bit of
the good if you can get almost all of the bad! I don't know!

I agree with your point about less experienced students and I think this fits
into what I'm getting at the "patch / pull request" section above: it's not
always feasible for a student to figure out the community, find a bug, submit a
patch, etc. This might point to a larger issue that it's too hard for new
contributors to get involved. I'm not sure making this a hard requirement is a
good idea, but I think requiring a "patch / pull request" is a way to fulfill my
three personal requirements above: "use, passion, and skill". This is certainly
not the only way, however! (Nor is it a guarantee of any sort.)
