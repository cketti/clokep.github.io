First, congratulations for your successful build! :)

* I don't think you need the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable
  Package" but it certainly doesn't hurt to keep it.
* On the buildbot we have VC2005 Pro. The express version won't be able to
  compile jemalloc (which most likely doesn't matter for development builds).
* The accessibility error is because you need the Windows 2003 SDK. Yes, in
  addition to the Windows 7 SDK. Yes, that's stupid. Microsoft apparently has a
  hard time including all the previously available files in the newer versions
  of the SDK.
* The testable executable is in objdir-ib-release/*mozilla*/dist/bin because of
  the comm-central build system.
* The flat chrome format is not as useful as it used to be as the new default
  chrome format (omnijar) packages the files only during make package and keeps
  flat chrome in the dist/bin/chrome folder.

Again, congrats! And thanks for documenting this!
