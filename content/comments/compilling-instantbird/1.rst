    First, congratulations for your successful build! :)

Thanks!

    * On the buildbot we have VC2005 Pro. The express version won't be able to
      compile jemalloc (which most likely doesn't matter for development
      builds).

Right, I remember reading that. But it's fine for development builds

    * The accessibility error is because you need the Windows 2003 SDK. Yes, in
      addition to the Windows 7 SDK. Yes, that's stupid. Microsoft apparently
      has a hard time including all the previously available files in the newer
      versions of the SDK.

Bah, that's ridiculous. Easier to disable it.

    * The testable executable is in objdir-ib-release/*mozilla*/dist/bin because
      of the comm-central build system.

Fixed, thank you. :)

    Again, congrats! And thanks for documenting this!

:)
