I'm sure I haven't though of all the scenarios (and there are probably valid
reasons for it).

Your suggestion is what a few IM clients do (I'm very surprised that Messages
does that since Apple is always touted as pushing the simplest solutions...). To
me per-account status is a power user feature, it's a complication that "most"
users don't care about (I have no hard evidence of this, but I only know of a
few instances of people asking for this). I think that this would make a great
extensions for Instantbird and/or Thunderbird; but I do not think it is
desirable in the default UI.

My reasoning for Invisible not being in the default UI is similar: it requires
some sort of advanced understanding of all the implications of enabling it.
Again it would be great for an extension to expose this option. Note that I do
think we should strive to have our protocols support it as best as possible, as
I suggested in `bug 802133`_.
