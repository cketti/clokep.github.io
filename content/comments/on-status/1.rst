Typically protocols that support multiple "unavailable" status types are those
that originally didn't have a status message that the user could type. (on the
other hand, protocols that had customizable messages from the begining never
needed these: AIM, Google Talk...)

The invisible status is bad for 3 reasons: (idealistic) it's a lie, (technical)
it's impossible to get right, (long term) it damages the network by making the
presence information (the thing that makes IM more useful than SMSes) completely
unreliable.
