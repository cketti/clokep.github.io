"[W]e're spending time to rewrite the IRC protocol implementation into
JavaScript -- we definitely think it's worth it and can lead to a bunch of new
unique protocol plug-ins for Instantbird."

earlier:

"[I]t would allow us to integrate protocols in any way that we see fit, instead
of only using APIs / methods provided by libpurple"

That's reason enough. When I first heard about you guys doing Instantbird, I
thought to myself, "Oh, neat", until I saw that it was using libpurple; Pidgin
with a different, XUL-based UI-which isn't really all that bad, but not as
malleable as it initially seemed.
