@Sevenspade: It's still a great difference in my opinion. Just keep in mind how
easy it is to create all sorts of extensions for the Mozilla platform. Someone
is currently working on an extension that offers a single-window solution for
Instantbird moving the conversation window and lists into one window. And he's
even using parts of the current UI. The same persons also decided to do an
app-button that replaces the menu bar with a button on the titlebar. Imagine
trying to do this with Pidgin...
