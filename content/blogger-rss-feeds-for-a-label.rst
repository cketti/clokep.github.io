Blogger has crappy support for RSS apparently.  I figured if I clicked
on a label, then found the RSS embedded in the page...it would give me
the RSS feed for that label, right?

Wrong.

Of course there's an \ `FAQ`_ page about this, but the syntax it gives
is broken.  For a specific label (I'm using the label "Instantbird"):

-  RSS:
   http://clokep.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/-/Instantbird?alt=rss 
-  Atom: http://clokep.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default/-/Instantbird

Who knows what versions of RSS/Atom these are.  But the feeds do exist.
