I'm again mentoring for `Google Summer of Code`_ 2014, this year my student is
`Saurabh Anand`_ (sawrubh), who has been working on a few related things:

* Adding a `file transfer mechanism for XMPP`_
* Hooking up libpurple's file transfer code to Instantbird
* Integrating FileLink_ as a fallback to in-protocol file transfers

Sorry for the way overdue post (as it's already past mid-term for GSoC)!
