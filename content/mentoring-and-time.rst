Google Summer of Code 2014
==========================

I'm again mentoring for `Google Summer of Code`_ 2014, this year my student is
`Saurabh Anand`_ (sawrubh), who has been working on a full related things:

* Adding a `file transfer mechanism for XMPP`_
* Hooking up libpurple's file transfer code to Instantbird
* Integrating FileLink_ as a fallback to in-protocol file transfers

On Time
=======

No, this is not about being late places, it's about respecting people's time. I
won't go super into this as, Michael Haggerty wrote an awesome article_ on this.
His thoughts boild down to a single line of advice:
"**DON'T WASTE OTHER PEOPLE'S TIME**".

I think this applies to more than just Google Summer of Code mentoring, and not
only open source work, but anything where someone is mentoring and helping you!
This advice isn't meant just for GSoC students, interns or new employees, but
also things I'd like to remind myself to do.

To make this sound a little more positive, I'd reword his advice as **Respect
people's time!**. Someone is willing to help you, so assume some good faith,
but help them help you. Some actions to focus on:

* Ask *focused* questions! If you do not understand an answer, do not *re-ask*
  the same question, but ask *followup* question. Show you've researched the
  original answer and attempted to understand it. Write sample code, play with
  it, etc. If you think the answer given doesn't apply to your question,
  *reword* your question: your mentor probably did not understand.
* Be cognizant of *timezones*: if you'd like a question asked (in realtime), ask
  it when the person is awake! (And this includes realizing if they have just
  woken up or are going to bed.)
* They will not have the *context* you do: your "mentor" might be helping many
  people at once, try not to get frustrated if you have to explain your context
  to them multiple times or have to clarify your question. You are living and
  breathing the code you're working in; they are not.
* Don't be afraid to *post code*. It's much easier to ask a question when
  there's an example in front of you. Be specific and don't talk theoretically.
* Don't be upset about an *r-* (a rejected change)! Part of helping you to grow
  is telling you what you're doing wrong.
* Working *remotely* is hard. It requires effort to build a level of trust
  between people. Don't just assume it will come in time, but work at it and try
  to get to know and understand your mentor.
* *Quickly* respond to both feedback and questions. Your mentor is taking the
  time out of whatever they're doing to help you. If they ask you a question or
  ask something of you, do it now (well...*soon*).

All of the above is a lot to handle, but it can make it a join to work with a
mentor.

Mentoring is also hard and a skill to practice. Although I've talked a lot
about what a mentee needs to do, it is also important that a mentor leaves
h(im|er)self open. A few thoughts on interacting as a mentor:

* Be cognizant of *culture* and *language* (as in how well a mentor and mentee
  share their common language). In particular, colloquialisms should be avoided
  whenever possible. At least until a level of trust is reached.
* Be tactful when *giving feedback*. Thank people for submitting a patch, give
  good, *actionable* feedback quickly. Concentrate more on overall code design
  and algorithms than nits. (Maybe even point out nits, but fix them yourself
  for an initial patch.)
