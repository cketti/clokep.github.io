Well we finally got our release process down a bit better and were
able to do a quicker release (from 1.2 to 1.3, compared to our previous
few releases). This is great news, as it gives incremental changes to
our users faster!  There's some new features available, which are mostly
covered on the `Instantbird blog`_, but quickly:

-  IRC now supports SASL authentication, which is required by Freenode
   when connecting from Tor or certain IP ranges.
-  Long messages over IRC are now smartly chopped and sent as multiple
   messages (instead of being truncated).
-  The "Show Nick" add-on was integrated: this allows styling of a
   mentioned nick in a conversation (and is extremely useful for
   following multiple conversations).
-  Various other minor improvements...

Instantbird 1.3 is based off of Mozilla 16.0.2, but I believe we're
hoping to update to mozilla-central soon in order to benefit from cool
new technologies, like WebRTC!  You should `check out Instantbird`_ now!
