After a bunch of l10n build problems, we've finally released
Instantbird 1.4, which includes updates to libpurple 2.10.7 and Mozilla
20.Â  In particular this includes:

-  Updated Twitter code that uses v1.1 of their API (v1.0 will be
   disabled on June 11th, 2013).
-  Better character counter for Twitter (it now takes into account if
   URLs are embedded).
-  Updated log viewer which organizes logs by date (and nests them by
   week, month, etc.)
-  Better support for IRC bouncers.
-  Support for overriding self-signed/invalid/out-of-date certificates
   for IRC.

If you've been using some other instant messaging client (e.g. Pidgin
or Adium); I'd highly suggest giving Instantbird a try, especially if
you also go on IRC. Instantbird has great IRC support! (And...if you do
have issues, feel free to ping me in #instantbird on irc.mozilla.org and
let me know what your issue is.)
