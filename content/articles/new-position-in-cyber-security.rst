.. note::

    If you're hitting this from `planet mozilla`_, this doesn't mean I'm leaving
    the Mozilla Community since I'm not (nor was I ever) a Mozilla employee.

After working for `The MITRE Corporation`_ for a bit over four years, I left a
few weeks ago to begin work at a cyber security start-up: `Percipient
Networks`_. Currently our main product is STRONGARM_: an intelligent DNS
blackhole. Usually DNS blackholes are set-up to block known bad domains by
sending requests for those domains to a non-routable or localhost. STRONGARM
redirects that traffic for identification and analysis. You could
`give it a try`_ and let us know of any feedback you might have! Much of my
involvement has been in the `design and creation of the blackhole`_, including
writing protocol parsers for both standard protocols and malware.

So far, I've been greatly enjoying my new position. There's been a renewed focus
on technical work, while being in a position to greatly influence both STRONGARM
and Percipient Networks. My average day involves many more activities now,
including technical work: reverse engineering, reviewing/writing code, or
reading RFCs; as well as other work: mentoring [#]_, user support, writing
documentation, and putting desks together [#]_. I've been thoroughly enjoying the
varied activities!

Shifting software stacks has also been nice. I'm now writing mostly Python code,
instead of mostly MATLAB, Java and C/C++ [#]_. It has been great how many ready
to use packages are available for Python! I've been very impressed with the
ecosystem, and been encouraged to feed back into the open-source community,
where appropriate.

.. [#] We currently have four interns, so there's always some mentoring to do!
.. [#] We got a delivery of 10 desks_ a couple of weeks ago and spent the
       evening putting them together.
.. [#] I originally titled this post "xx days since my last semi-colon!", since
       that has gone from being a common key press of mine to a rare one.
       Although now I just get confused when switching between Python and
       JavaScript. Since semicolons are optional in both, but encouraged in
       JavaScript and discouraged in Python...
