It was suggested that I cross-post this from mozilla.dev.planning onto
my blog. This is in reply to a thread entitled "`Proposal: Move
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey to mozilla-central`_" about (essentially)
merging comm-central back into mozilla-central. There have been many
technical concerns raised in the thread (that I'm not going to rehash
here). What I'm more interested in is the lack of community feeling
there. As Nicholas Nethercote said in that thread:

    "I am surprised [...] by how heartless the discussion has been."

I should note that I did have some help editing this down from my
original post. Turns out I tend to write inflammatory statements that
don't help get me point across. Who knew? Anyway, thanks to all of you
who helped me out there!

My full post is below (with a few links added and plaintext formatting
converted to HTML formatting):

    I agree, the technical bitshere seem to have solutions suggested by
    Joshua and others, but the non-technical parts of this discussion
    have left mefeeling disheartened and confused with the Mozilla
    community.

    I find it ironic/amusing/sad/upsetting that a few threads above this
    is a thread entitled "`Contributor pathways, engagement points and
    bug mentoring`_" while in this thread I see community contributors
    being blocked at every turn!

    Here I don't see people attempting to foster a community by putting
    their best foot forward. I see people trying to get their **job**
    done; with an attitude of "if this doesn't help me, get it outta my
    way!" I don't think this is the right way to grow a community. I
    don't think this is how Mozilla HAS grown it's community. I don't
    think it's in line with what Mozilla expects from it's community
    members (both employees and volunteers!)

    Personally, I dislike the amount of Mozilla **Corporation** goals
    focus in this thread. Can we have a discussion aspart ofa larger
    community? Why must it focus on Corporate goals? I'm not part of the
    corporation, I don't really care what its goals are or are not. I
    care about Mozilla, I care about providing high-quality, free, open
    source softwareto improve the experience of the Internet for
    everyone. And no, I'm not talking about Firefox. I'm talking about
    Thunderbird. I understand that Mozilla's goals arecurrently Firefox
    and Firefox OS, but these are not my personal goals.

    At the Summit I had a few conversations with people about
    "on-boarding" new employees and getting them to understand how the
    community works and that interacting with the community in a
    positive manner is an important part of Mozilla. I don't remember
    the exact context, but part of it wasthat it is important that new
    employees don't think of it as "How can I *use* the community?", for
    that implies taking advtange of them, but "How can I work with the
    community?"

    Please don't see this as an "employees vs. volunteers" argument. I
    believe that I'm expected to live up to these same goals. If I, as a
    volunteer, can help an employee achieve his goals; I'm
    [STRIKEOUT:more than willing], no...I'm EXPECTED to do that. I think
    this is a two-way relationship that must be fostered. It has seemed
    to me that over the past couple of years that I've been hanging
    around here there's been less and less focus on the community and
    more and more on the Corporation.

    I understand Thunderbird and SeaMonkey may not be important to you,
    but it is important tome! (And otherswho contribute
    totheThunderbird/SeaMonkey community, including employees who
    contribute on their spare time.) When Mozilla stopped directly
    supporting development of Thunderbird it was widely announced that
    "Thunderbird is dead!". We, as part of the Mozilla community, have
    been fighting to prove this wrong.Could you please respect our
    efforts? Merging c-c into m-c will help us focus our efforts on
    building a great product instead of spending significant effort on
    keeping a dying one on life-support. (And prove to all that
    "Thunderbird is dead!" was just a sensational headline.)

I don't have much else to say beyond that (besides thanks for reading
this far!)
