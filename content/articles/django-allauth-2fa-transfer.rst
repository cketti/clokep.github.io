I'm excited to announce the `django-allauth-2fa`_ project has a new maintainer!
It can now be found under the `valohai`_ organization on GitHub, who have
`already contributed`_ quite a bit to the package.

This project lets you easily add two-factor authentication to a Django project
using `django-allauth`_.

As a bit of history, this package was originally created by `Víðir Valberg Guðmundsson`_.
The package was then adopted by a previous employer, Strongarm (while there I gave a
`talk at Django Boston`_ about it). After acquisition we were phasing out support
for our own login (which I'm not actually sure if this has been finished or not),
but were not really maintaining the package. `Aarni Koskela`_ asked about taking
over maintainance and we gratefully have transferred it to them!

There's much more you could do with this package so I'm quite happy to see it in
the hands of someone actively using it!
