I was interviewed for Matrix Live as part of last week's `This Week in Matrix`_.
I talked a bit about my background and my experiences contributing to Mozilla
(as part of Instantbird and Thunderbird projects) as well as what I will be
working on for Synapse, the reference implementation for Matrix servers.
