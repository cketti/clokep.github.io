As `Florian announced`_ last Thursday, **now** is the time to brainstorm and
discuss project ideas for `Google Summer of Code 2015`_. Mozilla has
participated in every previous Google Summer of Code (GSoC), and hopes to
participate again this year! In order to help ensure we're selected, we need
project ideas before February 20th, 2015!

There are always projects that we're passionate about, but keep getting pushed
down our ever growing to-do lists. GSoC is a great opportunity to introduce a
new member to your team, and have a student work full time on a project for 3
months.

What makes a good project?
    * A project you're passionate about and has a clear mentor.
    * It should take (*a student*) roughly 3 months to design, code, test,
      review, etc.
    * It should not be in the critical path to your next release/milestone.
    * Is related to any Mozilla project (e.g. Firefox, Firefox OS, Thunderbird,
      Instantbird, SeaMonkey, Bugzilla, l10n, NSS, QA, SUMO, Rust, and many
      more!)

Please add ideas you might have to the `brainstorming page`_, eventually these
ideas will move to the `formal ideas page`_. Please ensure you read the
directions at the top of the page.

I'd also like to thank Gerv_ for doing an awesome job for the past 10 years as
the organization administrator. He is now passing the reins off to Florian and
I, who are the new points of contact for GSoC at Mozilla. If you have any
questions about GSoC, please check the FAQ_ and, if it is still not answered,
please contact Florian or I directly.

For Students
============

The application period for students is March 16th, 2015 to March 27th, 2015. It
is not too soon to start discussing ideas with a potential mentor/community,
however. If you have an idea of what you'd like to work on, feel free to seek
out that area of the community, introduce yourself and maybe find a `mentored
bug`_ to work on.
