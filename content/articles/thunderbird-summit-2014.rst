Last month (Oct. 15th to Oct. 18th, to be precise), `twenty volunteers`_
descended on Mozilla's `Toronto office`_ to discuss `Mozilla Thunderbird`_. This
included Mozilla employees, Thunderbird contributors of all sorts (developers,
user interface designers, add-on reviewers), Lightning contributors, and
chat/`Instantbird`_ contributors.

It was great to spend some quality hacking time with Florian_ and to meet
Nihanth_, both Instantbird guys who I talk to most days on IRC! I also had the
pleasure of re-meeting a few people from the Mozilla Summit last year (I
attended in Toronto) and to meet some brand new people!

    and Daniel (dialing in!)

It was really nice to actually sit down for a few days and work on
Instantbird/Thunderbird without the distractions of "real life". I,
unfortunately, spent the first day fixing an Instantbird bustage_ (from a
mozilla-central change that removed some NSS symbols...why, I have no idea). But
after that, we got some really exciting work done! We started cleaning up and
finalizing some patches from Google Summer of Code 2014 to add WebRTC_ support
to XMPP_! You can check out the progress in `bug 1018060`_.

    Other highlights of the trip include eating the "Canadian delicacy" of
    poutine (with pulled pork on it)!
