Mentoring and Time

No, this is not about being late places, it's about respecting people's time. I
won't go deep into why this is important as, `Michael Haggerty`_ wrote an
awesome article_ on this. His thoughts boiled down to a single line of advice:

    **DON'T WASTE OTHER PEOPLE'S TIME**

I think this applies to any type of mentoring, and not only open source work,
but any formal or informal mentoring! This advice isn't meant just for GSoC
students, for interns or new employees, but also things I'd like to remind
myself to do when someone is helping me.

To make this sound positive, I'd reword the above advice as:

    **Respect other people's time!**

Someone is willing to help you, so assume some good faith, but help them help
you! Some actions to focus on:

* Ask **focused questions**! If you do not understand an answer, do not *re-ask*
  the same question, but ask *followup* question. Show you've researched the
  original answer and attempted to understand it. Write sample code, play with
  it, etc. If you think the answer given doesn't apply to your question,
  *reword* your question: your mentor probably did not understand.
* Be cognizant of **timezones**: if you'd like a question answered (in realtime),
  ask it when the person is awake! (And this includes realizing if they have
  just woken up or are going to bed.)
* Your mentor may not have the **context** you do: they might be helping many
  people at once, or even working on something totally different than you!
  Try not to get frustrated if you have to explain your context to them multiple
  times or have to clarify your question. You are living and breathing the code
  you're working in; they are not.
* Don't be afraid to **share code**. It's much easier to ask a question when
  there's a specific example in front of you. Be specific and don't talk
  theoretically.
* Don't be upset if you're asked to change code (e.g. receive an r-)! Part of
  helping you to grow is telling you what you're doing wrong.
* Working *remotely* is hard. It requires effort to **build a level of trust**
  between people. Don't just assume it will come in time, but work at it and try
  to get to know and understand your mentor.
* **Quickly respond** to both feedback and questions. Your mentor is taking
  their precious time to help you. If they ask you a question or ask something
  of you, do it ASAP. If you can't answer their question immediately, at least
  let them know you received it and will soon look at it.
* If there are multiple people helping you, assume that they communicate
  (without your knowledge). Don't...

  * ...try to get each of them to do separate parts of a project for you.
  * ...ask the same question to multiple people hoping for different answers.

The above is a lot to consider. I know that I have a tendency to do some of
the above. Using your mentors time efficiently will not only make your mentor
happy, but it will probably cause them to want to give you *more* of their time.

Mentoring is also hard and a skill to practice. Although I've talked a lot
about what a mentee needs to do, it is also important that a mentor makes
h(im|er)self available and open. A few thoughts on interacting as a mentor:

* Be cognizant of *culture* and *language* (as in, the level at which a mentor
  and mentee share a common language). In particular, colloquialisms should be
  avoided whenever possible. At least until a level of trust is reached.
* Be tactful when *giving feedback*. Thank people for submitting a patch, give
  good, *actionable* feedback quickly. Concentrate more on overall code design
  and algorithms than nits. (Maybe even point out nits, but fix them yourself
  for an initial patch.)
