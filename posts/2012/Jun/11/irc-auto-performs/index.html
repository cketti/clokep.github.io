        <p>There have been a <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=742675">few</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1101">requests</a> to support &quot;auto-performs&quot;
(sending commands to the <span class="caps">IRC</span> server after connection that the user types
into a box or whatever). Personally I find this to&nbsp;be:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A fairly awful user&nbsp;experience.</li>
<li>Confusing to new&nbsp;users.</li>
<li>Unnecessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>I additionally don&#8217;t like this idea since it requires us to have
commands for all the common tasks you&#8217;d want to do in an auto-perform
(or support sending absolutely raw messages to the server, which we
actually do already in the /quote command). Essentially what I just
described is writing our own scripting language&#8230;that seems pointless
(and frankly, I have better things to do). I&#8217;m hoping to convince you
with this post (and maybe a series of posts) that auto-performs aren&#8217;t
necessary and a trivial restartless extension can replace&nbsp;them.</p>
<div class="section" id="design">
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Part of the desire to <a class="reference external" href="http://patrick.cloke.us/posts/2011/Apr/30/why-rewrite-the-irc-protocol-plugin-part-2/">replace the libpurple <span class="caps">IRC</span> protocol plugin</a>
with a new JavaScript one built specifically for Instantbird (which is
also now used in Thunderbird!) was to make the protocol fully
extensible. There are <a class="reference external" href="http://patrick.cloke.us/posts/2011/Mar/09/the-so-called-irc-specifications/">many revisions and unofficial extensions to <span class="caps">IRC</span></a>
and we might not necessarily want to support them all (especially if
they only apply to a single network). Allowing all parts of the protocol
implementation to be touched and extended seemed like a great way to
handle&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Initially I tried to do this by making the <span class="caps">IRC</span> account into an <span class="caps">XPCOM</span>
component (well it is one already, it&#8217;s an prplIAccount, but I meant an
<span class="caps">IRC</span> specific one: implementing ircIAccount, if you will). Unfortunately,
this seemed to have a lot of overhead and got complicated extremely
quickly. Anything I&#8217;d want to touch from a message handler (wait,
wait&#8230;what&#8217;s a handler?! I&#8217;ll get back to that) would need to have
methods written and exposed to access internal data of the
account&#8230;does that sound very extensible to you? Well, it doesn&#8217;t to&nbsp;me&#8230;</p>
<p>Onto design two! (Well actually my first design&#8230;) Lots of JavaScript
objects! The entire protocol is implemented as a set of JavaScript
objects and the handlers directly touch and modify the account&#8217;s data
(of course there&#8217;s methods for abstraction, etc.). This means that an
extension has absolutely <span class="caps">FULL</span> access to every about an account&#8230;this
also means an extension could seriously mess with and cause the protocol
to stop working or do really crazy things, etc. Unfortunately there
isn&#8217;t really a way to avoid that. Hopefully people write good&nbsp;code.</p>

<div class="section" id="messages">
<h2>Messages</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m going to go into an aside about messages right now, even though it
doesn&#8217;t quite seem relevent yet. It will. <span class="caps">IRC</span> has a bunch of
sub-protocols embedded within the <span class="caps">IRC</span> protocol (see the link above about
unofficial extensions). We attempt to parse all the string messages and
make pretty JavaScript objects out of them. I&#8217;ve actually identified
five (yes, count that: five) different sub-&quot;protocols&quot; within <span class="caps">IRC</span> that
we&nbsp;deal:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><span class="caps">IRC</span> itself (i.e. <a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459"><span class="caps">RFC</span> 1459</a> / <a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812"><span class="caps">RFC</span> 2812</a> / various numeric&nbsp;extensions)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html"><span class="caps">CTCP</span> (the Client-to-Client Protocol)</a>,embedded in <span class="caps">PRIVMSG</span> commands
of <span class="caps">IRC</span></li>
<li><span class="caps">DCC</span> (Direct Client-to-Client), a subprotocol of <span class="caps">CTCP</span></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brocklesby-irc-isupport-03"><span class="caps">ISUPPORT</span></a> (also known as Numeric 005), a method of negotiating
capabilities between a client and&nbsp;server</li>
<li>And finally, handling of <span class="caps">IRC</span> Services (there&#8217;s a lot of them and no
specification, but we treat them&nbsp;specially)</li>
</ol>
<p>Briefly what happens when we receive a raw message over the wire, we
create an <a class="reference external" href="http://hg.instantbird.org/instantbird/file/b8d8b6e60aef/chat/protocols/irc/irc.js#l14">ircMessage object out of it using a variety of regular
expressions</a>. This object has a variety of fields (see the link for
details), including the command, who sent the message and the&nbsp;parameters.</p>
<p>If the message is identified as a <span class="caps">CTCP</span> message, we then morph the
ircMessage into a <a class="reference external" href="http://hg.instantbird.org/instantbird/file/b8d8b6e60aef/chat/protocols/irc/ircCTCP.jsm#l44">CTCPMessage</a>, which can be morphed into a
<a class="reference external" href="http://hg.instantbird.org/instantbird/file/b8d8b6e60aef/chat/protocols/irc/ircDCC.jsm#l20">DCCMessage</a>. Additionally, a 005 reply can be parsed into a
<a class="reference external" href="http://hg.instantbird.org/instantbird/file/b8d8b6e60aef/chat/protocols/irc/ircISUPPORT.jsm#l22">isupportMessage</a>. And last, but not least, a received <span class="caps">PRIVMSG</span> can also
be parsed into a <a class="reference external" href="http://hg.instantbird.org/instantbird/file/b8d8b6e60aef/chat/protocols/irc/ircServices.jsm#l19">ServiceMessage</a>. Each of these extends the <span class="caps">IRC</span>
message without destroying information. (Yes, I&#8217;m realizing now that my
choice of whether to use capitals is all messed&nbsp;up&#8230;)</p>
<p>Well, why do we care&#8230;? By preparsing the strings into objects (as
defined by any &quot;specifications&quot; that exist), we keep extensions from
having to parse messages over and over again from&nbsp;strings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="handlers">
<h2>Handlers</h2>
<p>A handler is simply what I call the object that contains the methods
to deal with an incoming message. Pretty much, you get to say &quot;Only send
me <span class="caps">ISUPPORT</span> messages!&quot; or &quot;Only send me <span class="caps">CTCP</span> messages!&quot; and voila, you
only get that type of message. Each message type has a field that is
used to choose the method to run (for the <span class="caps">IRC</span> messages, the &quot;command&quot;,
for <span class="caps">CTCP</span> the &quot;<span class="caps">CTCP</span> command&quot;, <span class="caps">ISUPPORT</span> the &quot;parameter&quot;, etc.) This sounds
a lot more complicated than it is, I think a brief <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/clokep/irc-extras/src/6f778f17172a/example/bootstrap.js">example</a> is in&nbsp;order:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">ircSimpleExample</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// The name here is really only used in error messages.</span>
  <span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;IRC Simple Example&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="c1">// Slightly above the default priority so we run before the main IRC handler.</span>
  <span class="nx">priority</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">ircHandlers</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">DEFAULT_PRIORITY</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="c1">// Run this for all accounts (note that the &#39;this&#39; object in this method is</span>
  <span class="c1">// the JavaScript account object.</span>
  <span class="nx">isEnabled</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span>

  <span class="c1">// The commands we want to handle. For each of these, the account object is</span>
  <span class="c1">// bound to &#39;this&#39; and the single parameter is of the type that you&#39;ve</span>
  <span class="c1">// registered your handle.</span>
  <span class="nx">commands</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;001&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">aMessage</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// At the 001 response we&#39;ve successfully connected to the server.</span>
      <span class="c1">// Send an IDENTIFY command to NickServ.</span>
      <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sendMessage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;PRIVMSG&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;NickServ&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;IDENTIFY &lt;your password&gt;&quot;</span><span class="p">]);</span>

      <span class="c1">// Return false so the default handler still runs.</span>
      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Just like that we&#8217;ve designed a handler! Whenever the 001 method is
received from the server, this function will run and attempt to identify
with the NickServ (of course this could use a bit more security on it,
but it&#8217;s to demonstrate the possibilities). (The sendMessage function
takes the command to send and an array of parameters to&nbsp;send.)</p>
<p>As this is already a long post, I think I&#8217;ll cut this off now and
continue this at another time, but I hope I&#8217;m beginning to convince you
that allowing directy access to the account and protocol implementation
is a more powerful (and even simpler in many ways, in my opinion)
alternative to &quot;auto-performs&quot;. The one major downside I see to this, is
that it requires a bit more understanding of the actual protocol level
implementation, I don&#8217;t feel that knowing you need to use &quot;<span class="caps">PRIVMSG</span>&quot; as a
command instead of /msg is a huge issue,&nbsp;however.</p>
