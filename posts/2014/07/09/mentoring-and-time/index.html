</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>No, this is not about being late places, it&#8217;s about respecting people&#8217;s time. I
won&#8217;t go deep into why this is important as, <a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com/118086293667040637133">Michael Haggerty</a> wrote an
awesome <a class="reference external" href="http://softwareswirl.blogspot.fr/2014/03/my-secret-tip-for-gsoc-success.html">article</a> on this. His thoughts boiled down to a single line of&nbsp;advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong><span class="caps">DON</span>&#8217;T <span class="caps">WASTE</span> <span class="caps">OTHER</span> <span class="caps">PEOPLE</span>&#8217;S <span class="caps">TIME</span></strong></blockquote>
<p>I think this applies to any type of mentoring, and not only open source work,
but any formal or informal mentoring! This advice isn&#8217;t meant just for GSoC
students, for interns or new employees, but also things I&#8217;d like to remind
myself to do when someone is helping&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>To make this sound positive, I&#8217;d reword the above advice&nbsp;as:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Respect other people&#8217;s time!</strong></blockquote>
<p>Someone is willing to help you, so assume some good faith, but help them help
you! Some actions to focus&nbsp;on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ask <strong>focused questions</strong>! If you do not understand an answer, do not <em>re-ask</em>
the same question, but ask <em>followup</em> question. Show you&#8217;ve researched the
original answer and attempted to understand it. Write sample code, play with
it, etc. If you think the answer given doesn&#8217;t apply to your question,
<em>reword</em> your question: your mentor probably did not&nbsp;understand.</li>
<li>Be cognizant of <strong>timezones</strong>: if you&#8217;d like a question answered (in realtime),
ask it when the person is awake! (And this includes realizing if they have
just woken up or are going to&nbsp;bed.)</li>
<li>Your mentor may not have the <strong>context</strong> you do: they might be helping many
people at once, or even working on something totally different than you!
Try not to get frustrated if you have to explain your context to them multiple
times or have to clarify your question. You are living and breathing the code
you&#8217;re working in; they are&nbsp;not.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to <strong>share code</strong>. It&#8217;s much easier to ask a question when
there&#8217;s a specific example in front of you. Be specific and don&#8217;t talk&nbsp;theoretically.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be upset if you&#8217;re asked to change code (e.g. receive an r-)! Part of
helping you to grow is telling you what you&#8217;re doing&nbsp;wrong.</li>
<li>Working <em>remotely</em> is hard. It requires effort to <strong>build a level of trust</strong>
between people. Don&#8217;t just assume it will come in time, but work at it and try
to get to know and understand your&nbsp;mentor.</li>
<li><strong>Quickly respond</strong> to both feedback and questions. Your mentor is taking
their precious time to help you. If they ask you a question or ask something
of you, do it <span class="caps">ASAP</span>. If you can&#8217;t answer their question immediately, at least
let them know you received it and will soon look at&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>If there are multiple people helping you, assume that they communicate
(without your knowledge). Don&#8217;t&#8230;<ul>
<li>&#8230;try to get each of them to do separate parts of a project for&nbsp;you.</li>
<li>&#8230;ask the same question to multiple people hoping for different&nbsp;answers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is a lot to consider. I know that I have a tendency to do some of
the above. Using your mentors time efficiently will not only make your mentor
happy, but it will probably cause them to want to give you <em>more</em> of their&nbsp;time.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Mentoring is also hard and a skill to practice. Although I&#8217;ve talked a lot
about what a mentee needs to do, it is also important that a mentor makes
h(im|er)self available and open. A few thoughts on interacting as a&nbsp;mentor:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Be cognizant of <em>culture</em> and <em>language</em> (as in, the level at which a mentor
and mentee share a common language). In particular, colloquialisms should be
avoided whenever possible. At least until a level of trust is&nbsp;reached.</li>
<li>Be tactful when <em>giving feedback</em>. Thank people for submitting a patch, give
good, <em>actionable</em> feedback quickly. Concentrate more on overall code design
and algorithms than nits. (Maybe even point out nits, but fix them yourself
for an initial&nbsp;patch.)</li>
</ul>
