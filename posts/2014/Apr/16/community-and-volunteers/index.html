</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>It was suggested that I cross-post this from mozilla.dev.planning onto
my blog. This is in reply to a thread entitled &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21topic/mozilla.dev.planning/P8oHKTCWSiQ">Proposal: Move
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey to mozilla-central</a>&quot; about (essentially)
merging comm-central back into mozilla-central. There have been many
technical concerns raised in the thread (that I&#8217;m not going to rehash
here). What I&#8217;m more interested in is the lack of community feeling
there. As Nicholas Nethercote said in that&nbsp;thread:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;I am surprised [&#8230;] by how heartless the discussion has been.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>I should note that I did have some help editing this down from my
original post. Turns out I tend to write inflammatory statements that
don&#8217;t help get me point across. Who knew? Anyway, thanks to all of you
who helped me out&nbsp;there!</p>
<p>My full post is below (with a few links added and plaintext formatting
converted to <span class="caps">HTML</span>&nbsp;formatting):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Monday, April 14, 2014 4:52:53 <span class="caps">PM</span> <span class="caps">UTC</span>-4, Nicholas Nethercote&nbsp;wrote:</p>
<p>&gt; The technical aspects of this decision have been discussed to death,
&gt; so I won&#8217;t say anything about that. I am surprised, however, by how
&gt; heartless the discussion has&nbsp;been.</p>
<p>I agree, the technical bitshere seem to have solutions suggested by
Joshua and others, but the non-technical parts of this discussion
have left mefeeling disheartened and confused with the Mozilla&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>I find it ironic/amusing/sad/upsetting that a few threads above this
is a thread entitled &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.planning/1kbZsYoQcng">Contributor pathways, engagement points and
bug mentoring</a>&quot; while in this thread I see community contributors
being blocked at every&nbsp;turn!</p>
<p>Here I don&#8217;t see people attempting to foster a community by putting
their best foot forward. I see people trying to get their <strong>job</strong>
done; with an attitude of &quot;if this doesn&#8217;t help me, get it outta my
way!&quot; I don&#8217;t think this is the right way to grow a community. I
don&#8217;t think this is how Mozilla <span class="caps">HAS</span> grown it&#8217;s community. I don&#8217;t
think it&#8217;s in line with what Mozilla expects from it&#8217;s community
members (both employees and&nbsp;volunteers!)</p>
<p>Personally, I dislike the amount of Mozilla <strong>Corporation</strong> goals
focus in this thread. Can we have a discussion aspart ofa larger
community? Why must it focus on Corporate goals? I&#8217;m not part of the
corporation, I don&#8217;t really care what its goals are or are not. I
care about Mozilla, I care about providing high-quality, free, open
source softwareto improve the experience of the Internet for
everyone. And no, I&#8217;m not talking about Firefox. I&#8217;m talking about
Thunderbird. I understand that Mozilla&#8217;s goals arecurrently Firefox
and Firefox <span class="caps">OS</span>, but these are not my personal&nbsp;goals.</p>
<p>At the Summit I had a few conversations with people about
&quot;on-boarding&quot; new employees and getting them to understand how the
community works and that interacting with the community in a
positive manner is an important part of Mozilla. I don&#8217;t remember
the exact context, but part of it wasthat it is important that new
employees don&#8217;t think of it as &quot;How can I <em>use</em> the community?&quot;, for
that implies taking advtange of them, but &quot;How can I work with the&nbsp;community?&quot;</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t see this as an &quot;employees vs. volunteers&quot; argument. I
believe that I&#8217;m expected to live up to these same goals. If I, as a
volunteer, can help an employee achieve his goals; I&#8217;m
[<span class="caps">STRIKEOUT</span>:more than willing], no&#8230;I&#8217;m <span class="caps">EXPECTED</span> to do that. I think
this is a two-way relationship that must be fostered. It has seemed
to me that over the past couple of years that I&#8217;ve been hanging
around here there&#8217;s been less and less focus on the community and
more and more on the&nbsp;Corporation.</p>
<p>I understand Thunderbird and SeaMonkey may not be important to you,
but it is important tome! (And otherswho contribute
totheThunderbird/SeaMonkey community, including employees who
contribute on their spare time.) When Mozilla stopped directly
supporting development of Thunderbird it was widely announced that
&quot;Thunderbird is dead!&quot;. We, as part of the Mozilla community, have
been fighting to prove this wrong.Could you please respect our
efforts? Merging c-c into m-c will help us focus our efforts on
building a great product instead of spending significant effort on
keeping a dying one on life-support. (And prove to all that
&quot;Thunderbird is dead!&quot; was just a sensational&nbsp;headline.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much else to say beyond that (besides thanks for reading
this&nbsp;far!)</p>
