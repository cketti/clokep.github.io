</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>I briefly talked about <a class="reference external" href="http://patrick.cloke.us/posts/2013/10/20/google-summer-of-code-mentor-summit-2013/">my experiences</a> at the Google Summer of Code
2013 Mentor Summit. I&#8217;ve been pretty remiss in sharing what was actually
discussed there and for that I must apologize! This will hopefully be
one of a few posts about what I learned and discussed at the&nbsp;Summit.</p>
<p>The first part I&#8217;d like to talk about is the application period:
welcoming students, requirements for student applications, etc. Much of
what I say on here is just ideas I&#8217;ve heard other organizations
implement (with my personal opinion on them, please don&#8217;t think this
represents what Mozilla is suggesting students do, or even what I&#8217;m
suggesting Mozilla should ask students to&nbsp;do!)</p>
<p>I had many separate conversations about what is required for an
application to be accepted. It seems that Mozilla is actually on the
side of one of the easier organizations to apply to. We don&#8217;t (to my
knowledge) require that students have contributed at all to the
community beforehand. It is possible that some smaller communities
inside of Mozilla require more than just an application, but there does
not seem to be any rule across Mozilla. I said I wouldn&#8217;t offer my
opinion above&#8230;but I lied: I think Mozilla should make it clearer to
applicants what is expected of them before the&nbsp;application.</p>
<p>There seem to be a variety of things different organizations &quot;require&quot;
before accepting a student application, for&nbsp;example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A patch / pull&nbsp;request</li>
<li><span class="caps">IRC</span> / email involvement /&nbsp;idling</li>
<li>File a bug (I mean this in the &quot;Mozilla&quot; sense: an actual bug, a
feature request,&nbsp;etc.)</li>
<li>Fix a bug / make a&nbsp;commit</li>
</ul>
<p>I think all of these have pros and cons and making any a hard and fast
rule would probably be a bad idea. Personally for Instantbird, we
greatly encourage students to idle on <span class="caps">IRC</span> and get to know us; and to fix
a minor bug or two or three. What I&#8217;m always looking for is: use,
passion, and&nbsp;skill.</p>
<p>Asking for a <strong>patch / pull request</strong> (I include these together since
they really just depend on how an organization accepts changes) can be a
bit intimidating for a new user. I think this can be a pretty rough
thing to ask for new contributors that might not want to share their
work publicly with a large group of people (on a mailing list, public
bug tracker, etc.) where they might be wrong. Even after being part of
the community, I find that GSoC students are often very unwilling to
publicly share code unless it&#8217;s &quot;perfect&quot;, but I digress. Anyway, if
you&#8217;re considering &quot;requiring&quot; this, I think it should be pretty clear
that this changeset doesn&#8217;t need to be <em>perfect</em>, it just needs to show
that the student is able to read code, understand a bug report, provide
a fix and test&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s perfect reasonable to ask students to <strong>idle on <span class="caps">IRC</span> and
join mailing lists</strong>. They should definitely be trying to understand the
community before attempting to join it. It isn&#8217;t just a matter of if the
community thinks the student would be a good fit, but also the student
must ensure they can fit into the&nbsp;community.</p>
<p><strong>Filing a bug</strong> is a great way for a student to show a few different
things: they&#8217;ve used your software; they&#8217;ve used your software enough to
find a bug in it (and there most likely is one!); they&#8217;re able to
express themselves in a clear and concise matter. If you&#8217;re lucky
they&#8217;ll find something that actually annoys them and fix it&nbsp;themselves!</p>
<p>I have <strong>fix a bug</strong> listed last. You might ask how this differs from
submitting a patch&#8230;and it does! Fixing a bug requires a patch to go
through whatever review process your project uses, but builds upon just
submitting a patch. My thoughts on this are pretty similar to just
submitting a patch, but it depends on how large the bug&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>Something I found interesting is that almost everyone I talked to
didn&#8217;t treat their GSoC students any differently than they would treat a
new contributor to their project. They still had to prove they were
worthy of commit access, etc. Is there anything else you ask of your
students before they apply to GSoC? I&#8217;d love to hear&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>Some other topics I&#8217;ll hopefully find some time to write about
include: community lessons, and handling a failing student. The
community one will be very not-GSoC focused and could apply to just
trying to incorporate new contributors&#8230;but I&#8217;ll include it in this&nbsp;series.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m not dismissing the flip-side consideration, but I think it would be
important to consider how many past successful SoC projects might have not
happened given the requirements we&nbsp;consider.</p>
<p>I have no idea, but I know that students are often younger and the nature of
that is less experience and doing new things for the first&nbsp;time.</p>

                <p>Thanks for your feedback! I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s just early in the morning here,
but I&#8217;m having trouble understanding your sentence. I think you&#8217;re saying:
&quot;Given more stringent requirements, how many successful GSoC projects would not
have&nbsp;happened?&quot;</p>
<p>I agree that this would be an interesting number to look at. I&#8217;d also be curious
about the other: &quot;Given more stringent requirements, how many failed GSoC
projects would not have happened?&quot; Maybe it&#8217;s worth cutting out a little bit of
the good if you can get almost all of the bad! I don&#8217;t&nbsp;know!</p>
<p>I agree with your point about less experienced students and I think this fits
into what I&#8217;m getting at the &quot;patch / pull request&quot; section above: it&#8217;s not
always feasible for a student to figure out the community, find a bug, submit a
patch, etc. This might point to a larger issue that it&#8217;s too hard for new
contributors to get involved. I&#8217;m not sure making this a hard requirement is a
good idea, but I think requiring a &quot;patch / pull request&quot; is a way to fulfill my
three personal requirements above: &quot;use, passion, and skill&quot;. This is certainly
not the only way, however! (Nor is it a guarantee of any&nbsp;sort.)</p>

                <p>I think having the student fix a non trivial bug is interesting because it shows
how the student will handle the review process: will he be happy to be mentored
to improve the quality of his submission? Will he be annoyed that his patch
isn&#8217;t perfect the first time? Having these interactions tells a lot about how it
will feel like to mentor the student during the&nbsp;summer.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it should be required; but students should know it will be taken
into account by possible mentors while evaluation their&nbsp;applications.</p>

                <p>I agree it&#8217;s interesting to see how they handle feedback from a community and
you can learn a lot from it! I don&#8217;t know how I feel about &quot;requiring&quot; it (What
about for someone applying for a project that is from scratch?) But I think it
should be strongly&nbsp;encouraged!</p>
