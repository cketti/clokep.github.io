        <p>I briefly talked about <a class="reference external" href="http://patrick.cloke.us/posts/2013/Oct/21/google-summer-of-code-mentor-summit-2013/">my experiences</a> at the Google Summer of Code
2013 Mentor Summit. I&#8217;ve been pretty remiss in sharing what was actually
discussed there and for that I must apologize! This will hopefully be
one of a few posts about what I learned and discussed at the&nbsp;Summit.</p>
<p>The first part I&#8217;d like to talk about is the application period:
welcoming students, requirements for student applications, etc. Much of
what I say on here is just ideas I&#8217;ve heard other organizations
implement (with my personal opinion on them, please don&#8217;t think this
represents what Mozilla is suggesting students do, or even what I&#8217;m
suggesting Mozilla should ask students to&nbsp;do!)</p>
<p>I had many separate conversations about what is required for an
application to be accepted. It seems that Mozilla is actually on the
side of one of the easier organizations to apply to. We don&#8217;t (to my
knowledge) require that students have contributed at all to the
community beforehand. It is possible that some smaller communities
inside of Mozilla require more than just an application, but there does
not seem to be any rule across Mozilla. I said I wouldn&#8217;t offer my
opinion above&#8230;but I lied: I think Mozilla should make it clearer to
applicants what is expected of them before the&nbsp;application.</p>
<p>There seem to be a variety of things different organizations &quot;require&quot;
before accepting a student application, for&nbsp;example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A patch / pull&nbsp;request</li>
<li><span class="caps">IRC</span> / email involvement /&nbsp;idling</li>
<li>File a bug (I mean this in the &quot;Mozilla&quot; sense: an actual bug, a
feature request,&nbsp;etc.)</li>
<li>Fix a bug / make a&nbsp;commit</li>
</ul>
<p>I think all of these have pros and cons and making any a hard and fast
rule would probably be a bad idea. Personally for Instantbird, we
greatly encourage students to idle on <span class="caps">IRC</span> and get to know us; and to fix
a minor bug or two or three. What I&#8217;m always looking for is: use,
passion, and&nbsp;skill.</p>
<p>Asking for a <strong>patch / pull request</strong> (I include these together since
they really just depend on how an organization accepts changes) can be a
bit intimidating for a new user. I think this can be a pretty rough
thing to ask for new contributors that might not want to share their
work publicly with a large group of people (on a mailing list, public
bug tracker, etc.) where they might be wrong. Even after being part of
the community, I find that GSoC students are often very unwilling to
publicly share code unless it&#8217;s &quot;perfect&quot;, but I digress. Anyway, if
you&#8217;re considering &quot;requiring&quot; this, I think it should be pretty clear
that this changeset doesn&#8217;t need to be <em>perfect</em>, it just needs to show
that the student is able to read code, understand a bug report, provide
a fix and test&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s perfect reasonable to ask students to <strong>idle on <span class="caps">IRC</span> and
join mailing lists</strong>. They should definitely be trying to understand the
community before attempting to join it. It isn&#8217;t just a matter of if the
community thinks the student would be a good fit, but also the student
must ensure they can fit into the&nbsp;community.</p>
<p><strong>Filing a bug</strong> is a great way for a student to show a few different
things: they&#8217;ve used your software; they&#8217;ve used your software enough to
find a bug in it (and there most likely is one!); they&#8217;re able to
express themselves in a clear and concise matter. If you&#8217;re lucky
they&#8217;ll find something that actually annoys them and fix it&nbsp;themselves!</p>
<p>I have <strong>fix a bug</strong> listed last. You might ask how this differs from
submitting a patch&#8230;and it does! Fixing a bug requires a patch to go
through whatever review process your project uses, but builds upon just
submitting a patch. My thoughts on this are pretty similar to just
submitting a patch, but it depends on how large the bug&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>Something I found interesting is that almost everyone I talked to
didn&#8217;t treat their GSoC students any differently than they would treat a
new contributor to their project. They still had to prove they were
worthy of commit access, etc. Is there anything else you ask of your
students before they apply to GSoC? I&#8217;d love to hear&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>Some other topics I&#8217;ll hopefully find some time to write about
include: community lessons, and handling a failing student. The
community one will be very not-GSoC focused and could apply to just
trying to incorporate new contributors&#8230;but I&#8217;ll include it in this&nbsp;series.</p>
