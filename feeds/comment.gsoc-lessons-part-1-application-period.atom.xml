important to consider how many past successful SoC projects might have not
happened given the requirements we&amp;nbsp;consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea, but I know that students are often younger and the nature of
that is less experience and doing new things for the first&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

how the student will handle the review process: will he be happy to be mentored
to improve the quality of his submission? Will he be annoyed that his patch
isn&amp;#8217;t perfect the first time? Having these interactions tells a lot about how it
will feel like to mentor the student during the&amp;nbsp;summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think it should be required; but students should know it will be taken
into account by possible mentors while evaluation their&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;m not sure if it&amp;#8217;s just early in the morning here,
but I&amp;#8217;m having trouble understanding your sentence. I think you&amp;#8217;re saying:
&amp;quot;Given more stringent requirements, how many successful GSoC projects would not
have&amp;nbsp;happened?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that this would be an interesting number to look at. I&amp;#8217;d also be curious
about the other: &amp;quot;Given more stringent requirements, how many failed GSoC
projects would not have happened?&amp;quot; Maybe it&amp;#8217;s worth cutting out a little bit of
the good if you can get almost all of the bad! I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with your point about less experienced students and I think this fits
into what I&amp;#8217;m getting at the &amp;quot;patch / pull request&amp;quot; section above: it&amp;#8217;s not
always feasible for a student to figure out the community, find a bug, submit a
patch, etc. This might point to a larger issue that it&amp;#8217;s too hard for new
contributors to get involved. I&amp;#8217;m not sure making this a hard requirement is a
good idea, but I think requiring a &amp;quot;patch / pull request&amp;quot; is a way to fulfill my
three personal requirements above: &amp;quot;use, passion, and skill&amp;quot;. This is certainly
not the only way, however! (Nor is it a guarantee of any&amp;nbsp;sort.)&lt;/p&gt;

you can learn a lot from it! I don&amp;#8217;t know how I feel about &amp;quot;requiring&amp;quot; it (What
about for someone applying for a project that is from scratch?) But I think it
should be strongly&amp;nbsp;encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;
