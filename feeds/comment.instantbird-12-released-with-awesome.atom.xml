Thunderbird as well as Instantbird specific bugs. But I do review bugs for
Thunderbird chat specific stuff, occasionally file bugs in Thunderbird and work
on them and offer feedback as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s plenty of people interesting on continuing the work on Thunderbird and
there&amp;#8217;s a community of developers working to keep it viable. I think we&amp;#8217;ll see
Thunderbird around for a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
