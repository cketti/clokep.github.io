merging comm-central back into mozilla-central. There have been many
technical concerns raised in the thread (that I&amp;#8217;m not going to rehash
here). What I&amp;#8217;m more interested in is the lack of community feeling
there. As Nicholas Nethercote said in that&amp;nbsp;thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#8220;I am surprised [&amp;#8230;] by how heartless the discussion has been.&amp;#8221;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that I did have some help editing this down from my
original post. Turns out I tend to write inflammatory statements that
don&amp;#8217;t help get me point across. Who knew? Anyway, thanks to all of you
who helped me out&amp;nbsp;there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My full post is below (with a few links added and plaintext formatting
converted to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;formatting):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, April 14, 2014 4:52:53 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;-4, Nicholas Nethercote&amp;nbsp;wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The technical aspects of this decision have been discussed to death,
&amp;gt; so I won&amp;#8217;t say anything about that. I am surprised, however, by how
&amp;gt; heartless the discussion has&amp;nbsp;been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree, the technical bitshere seem to have solutions suggested by
Joshua and others, but the non-technical parts of this discussion
have left mefeeling disheartened and confused with the Mozilla&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it ironic/amusing/sad/upsetting that a few threads above this
is a thread entitled &amp;#8220;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.planning/1kbZsYoQcng"&gt;Contributor pathways, engagement points and
bug mentoring&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; while in this thread I see community contributors
being blocked at every&amp;nbsp;turn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I don&amp;#8217;t see people attempting to foster a community by putting
their best foot forward. I see people trying to get their &lt;strong&gt;job&lt;/strong&gt;
done; with an attitude of &amp;#8220;if this doesn&amp;#8217;t help me, get it outta my
way!&amp;#8221; I don&amp;#8217;t think this is the right way to grow a community. I
don&amp;#8217;t think this is how Mozilla &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HAS&lt;/span&gt; grown it&amp;#8217;s community. I don&amp;#8217;t
think it&amp;#8217;s in line with what Mozilla expects from it&amp;#8217;s community
members (both employees and&amp;nbsp;volunteers!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I dislike the amount of Mozilla &lt;strong&gt;Corporation&lt;/strong&gt; goals
focus in this thread. Can we have a discussion aspart ofa larger
community? Why must it focus on Corporate goals? I&amp;#8217;m not part of the
corporation, I don&amp;#8217;t really care what its goals are or are not. I
care about Mozilla, I care about providing high-quality, free, open
source softwareto improve the experience of the Internet for
everyone. And no, I&amp;#8217;m not talking about Firefox. I&amp;#8217;m talking about
Thunderbird. I understand that Mozilla&amp;#8217;s goals arecurrently Firefox
and Firefox &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;, but these are not my personal&amp;nbsp;goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Summit I had a few conversations with people about
&amp;#8220;on-boarding&amp;#8221; new employees and getting them to understand how the
community works and that interacting with the community in a
positive manner is an important part of Mozilla. I don&amp;#8217;t remember
the exact context, but part of it wasthat it is important that new
employees don&amp;#8217;t think of it as &amp;#8220;How can I &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; the community?&amp;#8221;, for
that implies taking advtange of them, but &amp;#8220;How can I work with the&amp;nbsp;community?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#8217;t see this as an &amp;#8220;employees vs. volunteers&amp;#8221; argument. I
believe that I&amp;#8217;m expected to live up to these same goals. If I, as a
volunteer, can help an employee achieve his goals; I&amp;#8217;m
&lt;span class="strike"&gt;more than willing&lt;/span&gt;, no&amp;#8230;I&amp;#8217;m &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXPECTED&lt;/span&gt; to do that. I think
this is a two-way relationship that must be fostered. It has seemed
to me that over the past couple of years that I&amp;#8217;ve been hanging
around here there&amp;#8217;s been less and less focus on the community and
more and more on the&amp;nbsp;Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand Thunderbird and SeaMonkey may not be important to you,
but it is important tome! (And otherswho contribute
totheThunderbird/SeaMonkey community, including employees who
contribute on their spare time.) When Mozilla stopped directly
supporting development of Thunderbird it was widely announced that
&amp;#8220;Thunderbird is dead!&amp;#8221;. We, as part of the Mozilla community, have
been fighting to prove this wrong.Could you please respect our
efforts? Merging c-c into m-c will help us focus our efforts on
building a great product instead of spending significant effort on
keeping a dying one on life-support. (And prove to all that
&amp;#8220;Thunderbird is dead!&amp;#8221; was just a sensational&amp;nbsp;headline.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t have much else to say beyond that (besides thanks for reading
this&amp;nbsp;far!)&lt;/p&gt;
