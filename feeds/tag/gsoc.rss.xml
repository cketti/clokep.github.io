&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years I’ve been involved in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/"&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt;
(GSoC), a program that sponsors students to write code for open-source
projects, as part of Mozilla. I’ve been both a mentor and administrator,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.queze.net/"&gt;Florian Quèze&lt;/a&gt; and I frequently get asked questions about what students
should do to apply to GSoC. This post aims to give some resources and
answers to those questions. (I should note that each open-source
organization is different and this is based on my experiences at Mozilla.
Your mileage may vary.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that none of this is meant as a guarantee for acceptance, it is
just a few things that can help get you ready and improve your chances!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard yet, then Mozilla has been accepted into
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/"&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; (GSoC) 2016, this will be our 10th time participating
in GSoC mentoring Organizations. Overally, the best way to prepare yourself for
applying to GSoC is to get involved with the community you would like to work
with. Some particular resources to help you in applying to GSoC are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go read the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/"&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; website. Every part of it. Particular
pages to point out are the:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCStudentGuide/"&gt;Student Guide&lt;/a&gt;: Written by a variety of people in the GSoC community,
it covers topics from contacting an organization, to applying, to not
being accepted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: If you still have questions after reading the above (or whenever
you have a question), check here for answers &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; asking anyone. (In
particular this includes questions about how to apply.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final important page to internalize is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/"&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt;. It is a
student’s responsibility to meet each of the deadlines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mozilla has some good &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode16#Application_Advice"&gt;application advice&lt;/a&gt; on the idea page. I’ve
included/expanded on this below:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to the mentor. Contact them on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt;/e-mail/Slack/whatever that
project uses. If you have trouble contacting a mentor, contact the
organization administrators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.gerv.net/2006/05/how_not_to_apply_for_summer_of/"&gt;How Not To Apply For Summer Of Code&lt;/a&gt;
and avoid doing the things listed there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read our examples of good applications:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/SummerOfCode/SampleApplications/1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/SummerOfCode/SampleApplications/2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/SummerOfCode/SampleApplications/3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is entirely acceptable to apply for 2 or 3 projects, if more than one
catches your eye; if the applications are high quality, that can improve
your chances. However, more than 3 seems like spam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that if a project suggests it would be helpful to know a technology
you don’t know (e.g. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XUL&lt;/span&gt;), you may be able to get away with learning on
the job. Don’t be put off from applying if the project otherwise looks
right for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="picking-an-organization"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id4"&gt;Picking an Organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick an organization you’re truly interested in helping. I really can’t stress
this enough. “Truly interested in helping” might mean many things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You believe in an organization on a philosophical ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You use the program/library/service/etc. that the organization produces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…many other things…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this post I use “organization” and “community” synonymously, but
organizations likely have smaller communities within them, each with their own
culture, beliefs, etc. Even within a small community, members will not share all
the same opinions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A pet peeve of mine is that a student should use (or at the very least
&lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt;) the product the community makes. It is difficult (if not impossible)
to understand the needs and wants of a community without utilizing what
they’ve poured their time and energy into.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="introductions"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id5"&gt;Introductions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different communities interact in different ways (and frequently a single
community interacts in multiple ways). Common ways include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instant messaging (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XMPP&lt;/span&gt;, Slack, hipChat, etc.) for day-to-day chatter,
help, and off-topic banter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E-mail / mailing lists / newsgroups for project wide discussion,
announcements, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug trackers (Bugzilla, GitHub, Trac) for technical discussion and reviewing code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose whichever way of introducting yourself that you’re comfortable with. It
can be useful to “idle” before introducing yourself (i.e.  watch how a community interacts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be important to figuring out a communities culture, e.g. how friendly
is the community to new-comers? Are they open to helping or do they just expect
patches to be submitted? Remember that it’s important for you to feel
comfortable with a community, you’ll be spending a significant amount of time
interacting with them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If none of the above seem appropriate, or you’re unsure, contact the
organization administrator directly. I’d suggest asking pointed questions, as an
organization administrator is much more likely to respond quickly in that case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-accepted"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id6"&gt;Getting Accepted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re frequently asked how a student can improve their chances of getting
accepted by an organization. GSoC is a very &lt;strong&gt;self-driven&lt;/strong&gt; program, especially
if your mentor is a volunteer. Being a self starter can be a boon for being accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a project you’re interested in doing and talk to the mentor / community responsible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure you have a development environment set-up (for example, make sure you
can build Firefox, understand what needs to be done after making changes, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out where resources are for the project (i.e. Where are technical
discussions? Where can you find documentation?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find minor bugs related to the project you’re interested in and work on
fixing them. (This might be more difficult if your project would add an
entirely new piece of code!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get used to the way the community works and functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="building-an-application"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id7"&gt;Building an Application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above should help feed into your application. In particular, it should help
to build a realistic schedule for your application. (Scheduling is difficult
even for seasoned engineers, but the above work should help make a more accurate schedule.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a plan for splitting your work into discrete chunks that can be
merged separately. Smaller changes are easier to review, can (generally)
land faster, and are easier to test. Of course, each project is different,
but work with your (potential) mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimate the amount of work each part of the project will take (you’ll have
some experience in the code base already, leverage that).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimate how long reviews will take. (All code at Mozilla must go through a
review process before it is merged into a product. You might even need
multiple reviewers if your code touches many different parts of a codebase!
Different people review code on different schedules, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand how quickly your changes would be merged and released. (How
quickly will your code hit a larger audience?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the pieces &lt;strong&gt;besides&lt;/strong&gt; code that you might be asked to do. Will
you need to add/update documentation? Add new tests? Keep an old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; intact?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="#id8"&gt;Summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a few ideas of what I look for when reviewing a Google Summer of
Code application. To repeat, try to understand an organization’s members, get
involved and gain experience, try to build an accurate schedule. An additional
thing I’d like to add is to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://patrick.cloke.us/posts/2014/07/09/mentoring-and-time/"&gt;respect your mentors time&lt;/a&gt;, especially for GSoC,
many mentors are volunteers! You’ll likely be working on their project &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt;
than they do during GSoC!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you have any additions or comments! If you have specific
questions that pertain to your application at Mozilla, please
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://patrick.cloke.us/pages/contact.html"&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; me individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

discuss project ideas for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.fr/2014/10/google-summer-of-code-2015-and-google.html"&gt;Google Summer of Code 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Mozilla has
participated in every previous Google Summer of Code (GSoC), and hopes to
participate again this year! In order to help ensure we&amp;#8217;re selected, we need
project ideas before February 20th,&amp;nbsp;2015!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always projects that we&amp;#8217;re passionate about, but keep getting pushed
down our ever growing to-do lists. GSoC is a great opportunity to introduce a
new member to your team, and have a student work full time on a project for 3&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;What makes a good&amp;nbsp;project?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ul class="first last simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A project you&amp;#8217;re passionate about and has a clear&amp;nbsp;mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should take (&lt;em&gt;a student&lt;/em&gt;) roughly 3 months to design, code, test,
review,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should not be in the critical path to your next&amp;nbsp;release/milestone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is related to any Mozilla project (e.g. Firefox, Firefox &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;, Thunderbird,
Instantbird, SeaMonkey, Bugzilla, l10n, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SUMO&lt;/span&gt;, Rust, and many&amp;nbsp;more!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please add ideas you might have to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode15:Brainstorming"&gt;brainstorming page&lt;/a&gt;, eventually these
ideas will move to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode15"&gt;formal ideas page&lt;/a&gt;. Please ensure you read the
directions at the top of the&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to thank &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.gerv.net/"&gt;Gerv&lt;/a&gt; for doing an awesome job for the past 10 years as
the organization administrator. He is now passing the reins off to Florian and
I, who are the new points of contact for GSoC at Mozilla. If you have any
questions about GSoC, please check the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2015/help_page"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and, if it is still not answered,
please contact Florian or I&amp;nbsp;directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="for-students"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For&amp;nbsp;Students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application period for students is March 16th, 2015 to March 27th, 2015. It
is not too soon to start discussing ideas with a potential mentor/community,
however. If you have an idea of what you&amp;#8217;d like to work on, feel free to seek
out that area of the community, introduce yourself and maybe find a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/"&gt;mentored
bug&lt;/a&gt; to work&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Patrick Cloke</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2015 13:18:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:patrick.cloke.us,2015-01-21:posts/2015/01/21/google-summer-of-code-2015-project-ideas-for-mozilla/</guid><category>mozilla</category><category>GSoC</category></item><item><title>Mentoring and Time</title><link>http://patrick.cloke.us/posts/2014/07/09/mentoring-and-time/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;No, this is not about being late places, it&amp;#8217;s about respecting people&amp;#8217;s time. I
won&amp;#8217;t go deep into why this is important as, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com/118086293667040637133"&gt;Michael Haggerty&lt;/a&gt; wrote an
awesome &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://softwareswirl.blogspot.fr/2014/03/my-secret-tip-for-gsoc-success.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on this. His thoughts boiled down to a single line of&amp;nbsp;advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DON&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;T &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WASTE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTHER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEOPLE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;S &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this applies to any type of mentoring, and not only open source work,
but any formal or informal mentoring! This advice isn&amp;#8217;t meant just for GSoC
students, for interns or new employees, but also things I&amp;#8217;d like to remind
myself to do when someone is helping&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this sound positive, I&amp;#8217;d reword the above advice&amp;nbsp;as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Respect other people&amp;#8217;s time!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone is willing to help you, so assume some good faith, but help them help
you! Some actions to focus&amp;nbsp;on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask &lt;strong&gt;focused questions&lt;/strong&gt;! If you do not understand an answer, do not &lt;em&gt;re-ask&lt;/em&gt;
the same question, but ask &lt;em&gt;followup&lt;/em&gt; question. Show you&amp;#8217;ve researched the
original answer and attempted to understand it. Write sample code, play with
it, etc. If you think the answer given doesn&amp;#8217;t apply to your question,
&lt;em&gt;reword&lt;/em&gt; your question: your mentor probably did not&amp;nbsp;understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be cognizant of &lt;strong&gt;timezones&lt;/strong&gt;: if you&amp;#8217;d like a question answered (in realtime),
ask it when the person is awake! (And this includes realizing if they have
just woken up or are going to&amp;nbsp;bed.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your mentor may not have the &lt;strong&gt;context&lt;/strong&gt; you do: they might be helping many
people at once, or even working on something totally different than you!
Try not to get frustrated if you have to explain your context to them multiple
times or have to clarify your question. You are living and breathing the code
you&amp;#8217;re working in; they are&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t be afraid to &lt;strong&gt;share code&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s much easier to ask a question when
there&amp;#8217;s a specific example in front of you. Be specific and don&amp;#8217;t talk&amp;nbsp;theoretically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t be upset if you&amp;#8217;re asked to change code (e.g. receive an r-)! Part of
helping you to grow is telling you what you&amp;#8217;re doing&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working &lt;em&gt;remotely&lt;/em&gt; is hard. It requires effort to &lt;strong&gt;build a level of trust&lt;/strong&gt;
between people. Don&amp;#8217;t just assume it will come in time, but work at it and try
to get to know and understand your&amp;nbsp;mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quickly respond&lt;/strong&gt; to both feedback and questions. Your mentor is taking
their precious time to help you. If they ask you a question or ask something
of you, do it &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASAP&lt;/span&gt;. If you can&amp;#8217;t answer their question immediately, at least
let them know you received it and will soon look at&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are multiple people helping you, assume that they communicate
(without your knowledge). Don&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8230;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230;try to get each of them to do separate parts of a project for&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230;ask the same question to multiple people hoping for different&amp;nbsp;answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is a lot to consider. I know that I have a tendency to do some of
the above. Using your mentors time efficiently will not only make your mentor
happy, but it will probably cause them to want to give you &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; of their&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentoring is also hard and a skill to practice. Although I&amp;#8217;ve talked a lot
about what a mentee needs to do, it is also important that a mentor makes
h(im|er)self available and open. A few thoughts on interacting as a&amp;nbsp;mentor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be cognizant of &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; (as in, the level at which a mentor
and mentee share a common language). In particular, colloquialisms should be
avoided whenever possible. At least until a level of trust is&amp;nbsp;reached.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be tactful when &lt;em&gt;giving feedback&lt;/em&gt;. Thank people for submitting a patch, give
good, &lt;em&gt;actionable&lt;/em&gt; feedback quickly. Concentrate more on overall code design
and algorithms than nits. (Maybe even point out nits, but fix them yourself
for an initial&amp;nbsp;patch.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Mentor Summit (you can read &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://patrick.cloke.us/posts/2013/12/02/gsoc-lessons-part-1-application-period/"&gt;the first part about the application
process&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will explore an interesting anecdote I heard about the
interaction between applicants from another organization that, on
reflection, seemed to resonate somewhat with what I had seen in my
corner of the Mozilla&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization these students were applying to required patches to
be fixed for a student&amp;#8217;s application to be accepted (as discussed in my
previous post). For a particular project there existed multiple highly
motivated and skilled students, but only one slot. Thus, a &amp;#8220;patch race&amp;#8221;
of sorts occurred where the students competed by continually providing
more patches that were increasingly complex. (Note that this wasn&amp;#8217;t a in
response to a challenge from community members, it was a spontaneous
situation.) Once a single student started to submit extra patches the
other students felt they must also submit more patches to be considered
equal/superior (hence my allusion to an &amp;#8220;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race#Nuclear_arms_race"&gt;arms race&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;).
Interestingly, they would also sometimes work on the same bug in a sort
of race to see who could fix it&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a couple things I took away from&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great, the project just had a lot of things&amp;nbsp;fixed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The students were investing escalating amounts of time &lt;em&gt;during the
application phase&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The students were not working in an open&amp;nbsp;manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#8217;t really expand much more about the first point, it&amp;#8217;s always
good to fix&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although submitting patches might showcase a student&amp;#8217;s skill, it also
relates to how much time the student is willing and able to put into the
application period. This, in particular, matters since different areas
of the world end their school year at different times. A student that
has already finished his semester during the application period may have
a lot of free time to attempt to get a GSoC slot (but will most likely
not have as much time during the actual summer!) This something that
mentors should keep in mind while reviewing&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A downside of increasing amounts of time invested is that the
rejection is that much harder for both the mentor (especially if the
student is now part of the community!), as well as for the student who
has now vested a large amount of time in the&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realization that actually upset me, however, is that these
students were not working in an open manner! Instead of collaborating,
they were competing! To me, this would set off a very poor tone for the
rest of GSoC. In fact, one of the biggest challenges I&amp;#8217;ve had with GSoC
students is getting them to work in the open (i.e. &amp;#8220;show me the code&amp;#8221;,
anyone in &lt;a class="reference external" href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/#instantbird"&gt;#instantbird&lt;/a&gt; is probably tired of hearing me say&amp;nbsp;that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; think this is a hypothetical case I made up!
Upon letting it sink in and reflecting on it&amp;#8230;I realized I had actually
seen similar situations during the application periods I&amp;#8217;ve been
involved with. This year, we found a bug in Instantbird&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; code (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CTCP&lt;/span&gt;
quoting and dequoting); after referencing some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://patrick.cloke.us/posts/2011/03/08/so-called-irc-specifications/"&gt;specifications&lt;/a&gt;, I was
pretty quickly able to figure out the vague areas where people should
look for a fix. A couple of GSoC students in the room started looking
into it and exhibited a greatly reduced form of the behavior I discussed
above. The students were sharing information, but were not comfortable
sharing code. Unfortunately, this led to some very vague questions which
I was unable to answer (or answered incorrectly) and led to me coining
my catchphrase from&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I by no means think this reflects poorly on our students! I think this
is some what natural and expected for most students unfamiliar with open
development. (Extrapolating from my experiences in school&amp;#8230;) Students
generally work individually (or in small groups) on projects and are
directly competing for grades (at least if the course is graded on a
curve). This would foster a sense of competition as opposed to
cooperation! Luckily the students working with us understood (with very
little prompting, I might add!) that we&amp;#8217;d prefer they work together and
help each other. We were able to successfully fix the dequoting bug
(which then caused a bug in the quoting code to be&amp;nbsp;visible&amp;#8230;sigh&amp;#8230;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;short take away&lt;/strong&gt; from all this: remember that students are not
yet a community and they&amp;#8217;re competing with each other until they&amp;#8217;ve been
accepted. (And that they&amp;#8217;re used to competing, e.g. homework and exams,
not collaborating!) I don&amp;#8217;t really know whether I feel the above
situation is good or bad, but it&amp;#8217;s certainly an interesting effect from
the way the GSoC process&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/p&gt;

2013 Mentor Summit. I&amp;#8217;ve been pretty remiss in sharing what was actually
discussed there and for that I must apologize! This will hopefully be
one of a few posts about what I learned and discussed at the&amp;nbsp;Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part I&amp;#8217;d like to talk about is the application period:
welcoming students, requirements for student applications, etc. Much of
what I say on here is just ideas I&amp;#8217;ve heard other organizations
implement (with my personal opinion on them, please don&amp;#8217;t think this
represents what Mozilla is suggesting students do, or even what I&amp;#8217;m
suggesting Mozilla should ask students to&amp;nbsp;do!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had many separate conversations about what is required for an
application to be accepted. It seems that Mozilla is actually on the
side of one of the easier organizations to apply to. We don&amp;#8217;t (to my
knowledge) require that students have contributed at all to the
community beforehand. It is possible that some smaller communities
inside of Mozilla require more than just an application, but there does
not seem to be any rule across Mozilla. I said I wouldn&amp;#8217;t offer my
opinion above&amp;#8230;but I lied: I think Mozilla should make it clearer to
applicants what is expected of them before the&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to be a variety of things different organizations &amp;#8220;require&amp;#8221;
before accepting a student application, for&amp;nbsp;example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A patch / pull&amp;nbsp;request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; / email involvement /&amp;nbsp;idling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File a bug (I mean this in the &amp;#8220;Mozilla&amp;#8221; sense: an actual bug, a
feature request,&amp;nbsp;etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix a bug / make a&amp;nbsp;commit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think all of these have pros and cons and making any a hard and fast
rule would probably be a bad idea. Personally for Instantbird, we
greatly encourage students to idle on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; and get to know us; and to fix
a minor bug or two or three. What I&amp;#8217;m always looking for is: use,
passion, and&amp;nbsp;skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking for a &lt;strong&gt;patch / pull request&lt;/strong&gt; (I include these together since
they really just depend on how an organization accepts changes) can be a
bit intimidating for a new user. I think this can be a pretty rough
thing to ask for new contributors that might not want to share their
work publicly with a large group of people (on a mailing list, public
bug tracker, etc.) where they might be wrong. Even after being part of
the community, I find that GSoC students are often very unwilling to
publicly share code unless it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;perfect&amp;#8221;, but I digress. Anyway, if
you&amp;#8217;re considering &amp;#8220;requiring&amp;#8221; this, I think it should be pretty clear
that this changeset doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;, it just needs to show
that the student is able to read code, understand a bug report, provide
a fix and test&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s perfect reasonable to ask students to &lt;strong&gt;idle on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; and
join mailing lists&lt;/strong&gt;. They should definitely be trying to understand the
community before attempting to join it. It isn&amp;#8217;t just a matter of if the
community thinks the student would be a good fit, but also the student
must ensure they can fit into the&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filing a bug&lt;/strong&gt; is a great way for a student to show a few different
things: they&amp;#8217;ve used your software; they&amp;#8217;ve used your software enough to
find a bug in it (and there most likely is one!); they&amp;#8217;re able to
express themselves in a clear and concise matter. If you&amp;#8217;re lucky
they&amp;#8217;ll find something that actually annoys them and fix it&amp;nbsp;themselves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;strong&gt;fix a bug&lt;/strong&gt; listed last. You might ask how this differs from
submitting a patch&amp;#8230;and it does! Fixing a bug requires a patch to go
through whatever review process your project uses, but builds upon just
submitting a patch. My thoughts on this are pretty similar to just
submitting a patch, but it depends on how large the bug&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I found interesting is that almost everyone I talked to
didn&amp;#8217;t treat their GSoC students any differently than they would treat a
new contributor to their project. They still had to prove they were
worthy of commit access, etc. Is there anything else you ask of your
students before they apply to GSoC? I&amp;#8217;d love to hear&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other topics I&amp;#8217;ll hopefully find some time to write about
include: community lessons, and handling a failing student. The
community one will be very not-GSoC focused and could apply to just
trying to incorporate new contributors&amp;#8230;but I&amp;#8217;ll include it in this&amp;nbsp;series.&lt;/p&gt;

Google Summer of Code, but Mozilla asked me to represent them at the
Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit!&amp;nbsp; This was located at Google&amp;#8217;s
offices in Mountain View, California this past weekend (Friday, Oct.
18th - Sunday, Oct. 20th,&amp;nbsp;2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before actually heading over to the Summit, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mykzilla.org/"&gt;Myk Melez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nickdesaulniers.github.io/"&gt;Nick
Desaulniers&lt;/a&gt; were kind enough to show me around the Mozilla Mountain
View office!&amp;nbsp; (Thanks to Daniel Holbert for setting that&amp;nbsp;up!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GSoC Mentor Summit is run as an &amp;#8220;unconference&amp;#8221;, the open sessions
were chosen by conference attendees and run as discussions with no
keynote speakers.&amp;nbsp; This was an interesting experience and how good each
session was varied quite a bit by who was taking part in the discussion,
but overall it was great to hear the experiences of other projects with
their GSoC students, as well as to hear about lots of projects I had
never heard of before!&amp;nbsp; In general the session I attended were about
community building and managing GSoC students, I took lots of notes and
will digest all of this in further detail at some&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to meet lots of great people from different projects, just
a few of which were: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pidgin.im/"&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.debian.org/"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://buildbot.net/"&gt;Buildbot&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.opendmx.net/"&gt;Open
Lighting Project&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.torproject.org/"&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.phpbb.com/%E2%80%8E"&gt;phpBB&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately
being from Mozilla, most people already know what you do&amp;#8230;or they think
you do at least!&amp;nbsp; Many people were surprised when I said I work on
Thunderbird and Instantbird.&amp;nbsp; I heard &amp;#8220;Thunderbird is dead&amp;#8221; at least
twenty times, which was quite disappointing that those in the open
source community don&amp;#8217;t even understand the current status of
Thunderbird.&amp;nbsp; Many were happy to hear that it is still being maintained
and developed by the community, however.&amp;nbsp; I even had some people thank
me (which I don&amp;#8217;t really deserve) for helping to continue maintain
Thunderbird!&amp;nbsp; It was great to hear things like this at the Mozilla
Summit, but it was really invigorating to hear people outside of the
Mozilla community excited that their favorite email client was still
being&amp;nbsp;developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People were further surprised to hear that Thunderbird now includes
instant messaging / chat (since Thunderbird 15 or 17) and that there is
a Gecko based instant messaging client: Instantbird.&amp;nbsp; It seemed like
some people were excited by this and hopefully they&amp;#8217;ll try it&amp;nbsp;out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#8217;ve gone a little off-topic, but overall the Mentor Summit
was great and I&amp;#8217;d like to thank both Mozilla and Google for giving me
this opportunity.&amp;nbsp; If I find any really great gems in my notes I&amp;#8217;ll
write further blog posts about&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

for taking so long to write this&amp;#8230;but anyway: Google Summer of Code
2013 is over!&amp;nbsp; Quentin has done a great job working at implementing the
Yahoo Protocol for Instantbird (and Thunderbird) in JavaScript
(henceforth called &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;-Yahoo&amp;#8221;).&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s at the point where it has mostly
reached feature-parity with the libpurple plug-in.&amp;nbsp; Before &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2135"&gt;turning this
on as default&lt;/a&gt; there are a few minor bugs that still need to be fixed,
but most of them have patches that just need another couple&amp;nbsp;iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="where-do-we-go-from-here"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do we go from&amp;nbsp;here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the last few bugs are fixed we&amp;#8217;ll enable Yahoo by default in the nightly
builds and, assuming we have no issues, it will be enabled by default in the
upcoming Instantbird 1.5. If there are no major issues in 1.5, we&amp;#8217;ll remove the
libpurple Yahoo implementation for Instantbird&amp;nbsp;1.next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-do-i-try-this-now"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do I try this&amp;nbsp;now?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can already easily enable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;-Yahoo in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nightly.instantbird.im/"&gt;Instantbird nightly builds&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type /about config in a conversation tab&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;textbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &amp;#8220;forcePurple&amp;#8221; in the search&amp;nbsp;box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove &amp;#8220;prpl-yahoo&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;prpl-yahoojp&amp;#8221; from this comma separated list
of values (you can also remove prpl-jabber if you want to always use
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XMPP&lt;/span&gt; implementation from GSoC 2011! Note that this doesn&amp;#8217;t
support &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14328"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SRV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;however.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart&amp;nbsp;Instantbird!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now be using the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;-Yahoo protocol.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully you don&amp;#8217;t
notice anything different, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.instantbird.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLEASE&lt;/span&gt; file bugs&lt;/a&gt; if you see any&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-come-i-can-t-use-this-in-thunderbird"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How come I can&amp;#8217;t use this in&amp;nbsp;Thunderbird?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Instantbird and comm-central development don&amp;#8217;t happen in the same
Mercurial repository.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;m working on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920801"&gt;syncing the chat/ folder of these
repositories&lt;/a&gt; currently and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;-Yahoo should be in Daily soon to be
included in the next Thunderbird release (i.e. Thunderbird&amp;nbsp;31).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole Instantbird community has been super happy with the progress
Quentin made and we hope that Quentin has learned a lot! Thanks for a
great summer qheaden and hopefully we&amp;#8217;ll see you around&amp;nbsp;still!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I&amp;#8217;m a bit late on posting this, but oh well! My student this year is
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://phaseshiftsoftware.com/"&gt;Quentin Headen&lt;/a&gt; who is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2013/qheaden/26001"&gt;working on&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Messenger_Protocol"&gt;Yahoo! Messenger protocol&lt;/a&gt;
for the Instantbird chat/ backend (so it&amp;#8217;ll also be usable via
Thunderbird). You can see &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://phaseshiftsoftware.com/blog/category/gsoc-2013-logs/"&gt;an account of his trials, successes and
trepidations&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://phaseshiftsoftware.com/blog/category/gsoc-2013-logs/feed/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) or follow his &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/qheaden/instantbird-gsoc-2013"&gt;code repository&lt;/a&gt;. He&amp;#8217;s made
great progress so far and is able to connect, download all the buddies
and start private conversations! Not too bad for a few weeks of work!
We&amp;#8217;ve been keeping a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/ELTNA6O44F"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TODO&lt;/span&gt; list&lt;/a&gt; of things to be supported, please
don&amp;#8217;t edit it without discussing it with us&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hope is to get this checked into Instantbird by the end of summer
and run it in parallel (behind an &lt;a class="reference external" href="about:config"&gt;about:config&lt;/a&gt; preference) with the
current libpurple Yahoo implementation. Once we&amp;#8217;re satisified that it
has feature parity we&amp;#8217;ll remove the libpurple version and enable this by&amp;nbsp;default!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instantbird is also supporting two other&amp;nbsp;projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2013/nhnt11/7001"&gt;&amp;#8220;Awesometab&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; is being done by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://awesometab.blogspot.com/"&gt;Nihanth Subramanya&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://awesometab.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)
