the front of the house to actually get mail). In order to avoid a draft during
the winter, the previous owner had shoved some insulation in the mail slot and
covered it with masking tape. This looked rather unsightly so I decided to do
something about it! The goal was for the outside of the door to still have the
mail slot, and for the inside of the door to look like a solid piece of&amp;nbsp;wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="text-center"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://patrick.cloke.us/images/mail-slot/before.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The inside of the mail slot before any work was done." src="/thumbnails/mail-slot/before_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://patrick.cloke.us/images/mail-slot/outside.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The outside of the mail slot." src="/thumbnails/mail-slot/outside_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inside and outside of the door before any work was&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was to remove the metal bracket on the inside. It initially
seemed that the front and back plates were connected: they weren&amp;#8217;t, which made
this much easier. This was achived by simply removing four screws (that were
covered in probably ten layers of&amp;nbsp;paint).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="text-center"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://patrick.cloke.us/images/mail-slot/no-back-plate.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="After removal of the back plate." src="/thumbnails/mail-slot/no-back-plate_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After removing the back plate of the mail&amp;nbsp;slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was desired to insulate the hole before filling it, but before doing that I
wanted to ensure that the mail slot could not be opened from the outside. (The
flap tended to get stuck on the insulation and there would not be an easy way to
close it afterward.) A thin piece of wood was glued to the bottom of the hole to
block the flap from opening. Once the glue dried, the insulation was&amp;nbsp;replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="text-center"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://patrick.cloke.us/images/mail-slot/flap-stop-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Waiting for the glue to dry. Papertowels were used to pressure the stop to the bottom of the whole." src="/thumbnails/mail-slot/flap-stop-1_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A (crude) patch was fashioned from balsa wood to fit the hole. (This is
&lt;span class="strike"&gt;almost&lt;/span&gt; definitely not the correct material, but it was easy to work
with and will not be bearing any weight.) The first step was to make patch match
the size and shape of the hole as closely as possible. A brace was glued on the
back to keep the patch from flexing. This was inserted into the hole with some
glue around the edges to keep it in&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="text-center"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://patrick.cloke.us/images/mail-slot/patch-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The patch fashioned to match the mail slot hole." src="/thumbnails/mail-slot/patch-1_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://patrick.cloke.us/images/mail-slot/patch-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The patch inserted into the mail slot." src="/thumbnails/mail-slot/patch-2_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The patch fashioned to match the mail slot hole. (2) The patch inserted
into the mail&amp;nbsp;slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the glue dried, the surface was lightly sanded, then wood putty was applied
around the edges to smooth the transition from the door to the patch. This was
repeated a few&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="text-center"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://patrick.cloke.us/images/mail-slot/putty-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The patch with wood putty." src="/thumbnails/mail-slot/putty-1_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://patrick.cloke.us/images/mail-slot/putty-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The patch between sandings." src="/thumbnails/mail-slot/putty-2_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patch with wood putty around it and then&amp;nbsp;sanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few coats of paint were used to match the rest of the door. It looks good
except under certain light where you can see the outline of the patch. Overall,
this took only a few hours (plus time waiting for glue, putty, or paint to dry)
and the overall cost was less than $5 (for the wood for the patch, the other
material was already on&amp;nbsp;hand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="text-center"&gt;
