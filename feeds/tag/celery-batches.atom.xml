&lt;p&gt;celery-batches is a small library that allows you process multiple calls to a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/celery/celery/"&gt;Celery&lt;/a&gt; task together. The batches can be processed based on a count of task
calls or a timer. It started as an update of the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;celery.contrib.batches&lt;/tt&gt;
code to support Celery 4.0+ and has grown to support some additional&amp;nbsp;features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was also transferred on GitHub to my personal namespace (from my
previous employer). Realistically it was maintained by me already and this is
just a formality. As part of this release the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://celery-batches.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; is now available
on Read the&amp;nbsp;Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
